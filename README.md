- 👋 Hi, I’m @bry-py
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a master of python so that I can work in AI,machine learning,or  finance( I went to school for finance)...but I want do something really cool and sci-fi movieish...so most likely working in ai/machine learning/deep learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python in a book called Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, then I will go through the Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way but in between these two books I'm going to research practial applications of pythons.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything cool and futuristic out of sci-fi movie. I'm eager to learn anything and everything.
- 📫 How to reach me is on here for now.
